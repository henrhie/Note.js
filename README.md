Note.js introduces a new paradigm of running javascript code in your favorite editor, vscode. With support for HTML, CSS and Javascript, you can think of each cell as a module which can be imported into other cells like you would do in a traditional javascript project.

### Javascript

Running Javascript in Note.js is just as simple as click the run button next to a cell. ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è Note.js does not run code cumulatively as it is in Jupyter Notebook. The code cell that is run is treated as the entry code and any code in any cell that is needed can be imported. The convention to name cells as javascript modules is:

```javascript
//<module-name>// ‚ö†Ô∏è without .js at the top of the cell

//...rest of code
```

You probably might be wondering how you are going to use your favourite npm modules like React and Lodash. Well you don't need to worry about npm or node_modules - Just import them as you would in your javascript project. Under the hood, Note.js uses custom esbuild plugins to fetch source code of npm packages from https://unpkg.com and bundles everything together.

And don't worry about fetching packages on every execution - every package that is fetched is cached in memory.

### Html

The default supported language for a cell is javascript. You can change it by clicking the language shown at the button right corner and selecting the prefered language from the pop-up menu. To name an html cell, just comment it out at the top of the cell
Eg. `html <!-- index.html --> `
And begin writing your html. Note that you do not need to write any boilerplate html code - just hit the ground running with your ideas.

### React

Note.js has first class support for React.js. As in a normal react project, you just need some html and javascript code.
